This file contains all operated changes and adds on the project.

-= First commit: Initial commit, setting up the base. Topological structure and character configuration.
Next thing to work on, is the Search and Generation process. But before doing the Search/Generation we 
need to implement the social tree of a character.

Probably will create a website to provide more insight about obscure definitions of "Social tree" or "Topology"

-= Second commit: Fixed the topology generator error. As we took the index of the character instead of a general
square target value. Which made column, row calcuation err.
