Topology means a classroom. Name "Topology" is a fancy mathematical term for shapes and inrelationships.
The name was chosen to represent a general case, not a specific.

-= First commit: Initial commit, setting up the base. Topological structure and character configuration.
Next thing to work on, is the Search and Generation process. But before doing the Search/Generation we 
need to implement the social tree of a character.

Probably will create a website to provide more insight about obscure definitions of "Social tree" or "Topology"

-= Second commit: Fixed the topology generator error. As we took the index of the character instead of a general
square target value. Which made column, row calcuation err. 

-= Third commit: Evaluation. Simple static evaluation as I didn't implement yet a social tree.

+ Evaluation is returned into a 10log_10(x) format called Rabhi-Stokers unit. This scale is important. As topologies
are differentiated by big margins using small units. It doesn't really matter what you use. But, Rabhi-Stokers works
quite well. 

To get the raw score as it was is simple: y = 10log_10(x) / 10^(y/10) = x.

-= Four commit: Dynamic evaluation. Note that dynamic evaluation isn't reciprocal ! Meaning, it won't reflect the fitness directly
but the calculated potential. Thus, to obtain the real evaluation by blending dynamic and static. Substract static evaluation by dynamic
evaluation and you get the real score.

Note: AGP-3 involves topology selection in a complex order. Primitive configurations and children topologies. Will note that in the second draft.
For now, focus on the base that is AGP-2.

-= Fifth commit: Topology position generation. Update function for hash and constructor for the topology ofc.

-= Sixth commit: Adding a README.md and a license to dock the project on github.
