## Overview
AGP-3 (Algorithm of Generative Procedural Augmented Topologies 3) is made for the purpose of organizing
set based on social potentials and communication potentials. Blend it with some generative raw topologies
that are logarithmically evaluated and classified throughout the entire process to determine the best
topology to adopt in real-life. Of course keep in mind that, this algorithm is probabilistic and not
deterministic. Meaning that the end-goal is to abort or drown the social capabilities. The end-goal 
is to prevent and temper social communication.

## Keywords 
Social potential is the ability of a character <bold>(Member of a Topology)</bold> to uphold and keep
social interactions. It is measured throughout differents equations that don't reflect completely the behaviour
of each character through a topology. 

Topology is the set where characters evolve throughout. Topologies are studied and correlated, studying 
their relationships and deduct deviatory values.

## Project Evolution 
AGP-3 is still in process, while the first draft will be completed. I except a third draft where the algorithm 
becomes evolutive and generative with deep statiscal analysis.

Of course, the project is under GPL license where it allows you to fork the project and contribute to it by respecting the terms of the license thouroughly.
